        God is a concept  <br>
        By which we measure <br>
        Our pain <br>
        I'll say it again <br>
        God is a concept <br>

        The dream is over <br>
        What can I say? <br>
        The dream is over <br>
        Yesterday <br>
        I was the Dreamweaver <br>
        But now I'm reborn <br>
        I was the Walrus <br>
        But now I'm John <br>
        And so dear friends <br>
        You'll just have to carry on <br>
        The dream is ove<br>
